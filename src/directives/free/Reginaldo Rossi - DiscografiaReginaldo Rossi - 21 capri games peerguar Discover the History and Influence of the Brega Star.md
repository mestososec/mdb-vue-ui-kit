But who was Reginaldo Rossi and why is he so important for Brazilian music? Reginaldo Rossi was born in 1944 in Recife, the capital of Pernambuco state. He started his musical career as a rock and roll singer, influenced by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. He formed his own band, The Silver Jets, and recorded some songs in English. However, he soon realized that he had more success singing in Portuguese and adapting to the local taste.
 
He then switched to brega music, which is a genre that emerged in the 1960s in the northeastern region of Brazil. Brega means "tacky" or "cheesy" in Portuguese, and it refers to the low-budget production, simple melodies, and sentimental lyrics of this style. Brega music was often criticized by the critics and the elites, but it was very popular among the masses, especially the lower classes and the migrants from the countryside.
 
Reginaldo Rossi became one of the most successful and influential brega singers of all time. He had a distinctive voice, a charismatic stage presence, and a knack for writing catchy and romantic songs. He also incorporated elements from other genres, such as bolero, forrÃ³, samba, and funk. He was able to appeal to a wide audience, from young people to old people, from men to women, from urban to rural areas. He was admired by many other artists, such as Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, and Chico Buarque.
