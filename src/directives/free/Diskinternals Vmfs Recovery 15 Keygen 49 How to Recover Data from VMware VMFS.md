## VMware VMFS Data Recovery Tips
 
Recovering data from VMware VMFS partitions can be challenging, especially if you encounter some common problems such as lost partition table, corrupted file system, or deleted files. However, there are some tips and tricks that can help you overcome these difficulties and restore your data successfully. Here are some of them:
 
- Use a reliable and compatible VMFS recovery software. There are many tools available in the market that claim to recover data from VMware VMFS partitions, but not all of them are effective and trustworthy. Some of them may even cause more damage to your data or overwrite it with junk. Therefore, you should choose a software that has a good reputation, supports all versions of VMware ESX and vSphere, and can handle different types of VMFS formats, RAID arrays, and encryption. One such software is Diskinternals Vmfs Recovery 15 Keygen 49, which we have discussed in the previous section.
- Do not write anything to the VMFS partition. If you have lost data from your VMFS partition, you should avoid writing anything to it until you recover your data. Writing new data may overwrite the existing data or make it unrecoverable. This includes creating new files, deleting files, formatting the partition, or adding new extents. You should also disconnect the VMFS partition from any active hosts or virtual machines that may access it.
- Backup your VMFS partition before attempting recovery. Even if you use a reliable and compatible VMFS recovery software, there is always a risk of losing data during the recovery process. Therefore, it is advisable to backup your VMFS partition before attempting recovery. You can use a disk imaging tool to create a clone or an image of your VMFS partition and save it to another location. This way, you can restore your VMFS partition to its original state if something goes wrong during the recovery.
- Recreate the partition table if it is lost. Sometimes, the partition table of your VMFS partition may get corrupted or deleted due to various reasons such as power failure, disk failure, virus attack, or human error. This may make your VMFS partition inaccessible or unrecognizable by VMware ESX or vSphere. In this case, you can try to recreate the partition table using fdisk command in ESX service console or ESXi tech support mode. You need to know the exact size and offset of your VMFS partition before recreating it. You can refer to this VMware KB article for more details: Recovering a lost partition table on a VMFS volume (1002281)[^3^].
- Use vmfs-undelete script or VMDK Recovery Tool if you have deleted files. If you have accidentally deleted files from your VMFS partition, you may be able to recover them using vmfs-undelete script or VMDK Recovery Tool. These tools require proactive steps to protect the VMFS datastore by generating a block-list file that keeps a record of all VMDKs of the virtual machines on the datastore. If you have this file, you can use these tools to scan and recover deleted files from your VMFS partition. However, these tools have some limitations such as they are experimental and unsupported by VMware, they work only on ESX 3.x and not on ESXi or ESX 4.x, and they cannot restore from multiple block-list files. You can refer to this VMware community article for more details: VMFS Recover or Undelete[^2^].

These are some of the tips and tricks that can help you recover data from VMware VMFS partitions with Diskinternals Vmfs Recovery 15 Keygen 49 or other methods. However, you should always remember that data recovery is not guaranteed and depends on various factors such as the extent of damage, the type of data loss, and the availability of backups. Therefore, you should always backup your data regularly and test your backups for integrity and usability.
