Cisco IP Communicator has a distinct advantage in the IP telephony applications space over competing systems because of the robustness of the Cisco Technology Developer ecosystem. Because Cisco has the largest installed base of IP phones of any competitor and holds the largest share of the market, more than 300 Cisco Technology Developer partners are actively developing applications[^2^]. This is due also, in part, to the long-term Cisco commitment to maintaining Extensible Markup Language (XML) as an open standard and the companyâs development of an open interface. Besides XML, Cisco IP Communications applications are also based on other industry standards such as the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) and Java TAPI (JTAPI). Cisco also has created a wealth of resources such as programming guides, FAQ libraries, discussion forums, software development kits, and a robust developer support program. All these resources have made it easier for IP Communications applications developers to build applications for Cisco CallManager and Cisco CallManager Express, which provide customers with many more off-the-shelf applications than are available with any other competitor.
