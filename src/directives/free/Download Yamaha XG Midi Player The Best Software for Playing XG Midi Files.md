## What is Yamaha XG MIDI Player?
 
Yamaha XG MIDI Player is a software that uses a virtual instrument (VSTi) plugin to reproduce the sounds of the Yamaha XG sound module. Yamaha XG is an extension of the General MIDI (GM) standard that adds more voices, effects, and controllers to enhance the musical expression of MIDI files. Yamaha XG MIDI Player can play both GM and XG MIDI files, as well as record them to WAV files.
